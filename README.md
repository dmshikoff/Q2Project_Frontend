## The What
MTG Assistant is a web app for Magic, The Gathering players. 
The app allows the user to catologue their entire 
Magic, The Gathering library and then build decks from it.

## The Why
Players begin amassing a large collection of cards very quickly that can become difficult to manage. 
Organizing your cards library takes many painfull hours and can become completely undone anytime you attempt to build a new deck. 
This app will now allow you to create decks digitally without the need to pull apart your entire organized collection.

## The How
I utilized the following technologies:
* JavaScript
* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap
* Live Server
* Ajax/Axios
* Node/Express
* PostgreSQL
* Heroku
* Magic, The Gathering API
